# Assessment_1

Hereâ€™s a well-rounded assessment for a junior frontend developer. It includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic React tasks, and a bonus section to gauge additional skills.

---
#### **Part 1: HTML & CSS (25 points)**

1. **Task 1:** Create a simple webpage with the following structure:  
   - A **navigation bar** with links (Home, About, Contact)  
   - A **header** section with a title  
   - A **main content section** with a paragraph and an image  
   - A **footer** with copyright information

   **Requirements:**
   - The navigation bar should be styled to be horizontally aligned.
   - Use semantic HTML tags (header, main, footer, nav, etc.).
   - Apply basic styling (e.g., colors, margins, padding, fonts).
   - Make the layout **responsive** (use media queries to adjust for mobile view).

   **Bonus (5 points):**  
   Use Flexbox or Grid to layout the navigation bar and footer.

---

#### **Part 2: JavaScript Fundamentals (30 points)**

2. **Task 2:** Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers as an input and returns the sum of all **even** numbers.

   Example:  
   ```javascript
   sumEvenNumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // Returns 6 (2 + 4)
   ```

3. **Task 3:** Implement a simple **To-Do List** where:
   - Users can add tasks.
   - Users can delete tasks.
   - Users can mark tasks as "completed" by clicking on them.

   **Requirements:**
   - Use JavaScript to handle adding, deleting, and marking tasks.

#### **Part 3: CSS Flexbox/Grid Layout (20 points)**

4. **Task 4:** Create a responsive two-column layout using **Flexbox or Grid**.
   - The layout should have:
     - A **sidebar** on the left.
     - A **main content** area on the right.
   - On smaller screens, the layout should adjust to a single column with the sidebar on top and the content below.

---

#### **Part 4: JavaScript Event Handling (15 points)**

5. **Task 5:** Create a button that, when clicked, changes the text of a paragraph to "Hello, [user's name]!".  
   - The name should be entered into an input field.
   - When the user clicks the button, the name entered should be displayed in the paragraph.
